# Progress

- Read root/service instructions, maintenance and verification skills, planning and desktop skills.
- Project ownership, local native picking and remote Host picking are separate responsibilities.
- Added OpenCraft ProjectRepository, Host project RPCs and narrow Electron native picker.
- Connected shared menu with native capability and interaction epoch fencing; remote filesystem picker retained.
- First focused tests: 12/12 passed; local Host, Electron and Web typechecks passed.
- Added real WebSocket Host restart test using an unreachable engine to verify ownership separation.
- Focused project suite now 13/13; full gate running. Native late errors are fenced as well as successful selections.
- Full gate passed. First signed preview invoked the real native system dialog; native CUA could not connect, so real cancel-click remains unverified.
- Automated end-to-end timing exposed unavailable Host transport; menu now requires ready and explains the connection prerequisite. Final renderer/package and ready-gated smoke running.
- Signed final package passed actual Electron smoke with dialog result mocked: cancellation, directory create/select, duplicate identity, late selection after Settings navigation, catalog restoration across app restart; no paid model call or real configuration writes.
- Opened final preview with independent profile and CDP 19824, normal product storage read-only during inspection.
- Final `npm run gate` exit 0; final signed Electron smoke passed. User-facing preview has Connected Local and enabled Add project, screenshot `/tmp/opencraft-project-picker-preview.png`.
- Root documentation/changed-file impact checks passed; full repository context tests reported historical issues and task format issues introduced by this pack, now corrected (multiline source_of_truth, triggers, requirement_ids, Chinese human text). Rebuilt catalog after retirement. No Git submission.
