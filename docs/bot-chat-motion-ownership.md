# Bot Chat motion ownership

This note defines the ownership boundaries for the Bot-native conversation surface: its 39-state vocabulary, 18 shape families, effect mapping, eye topology, pointer following, Stage registry, spring clock, group presence and transcript gating. The current implementation and invariants below define the runtime contract.

## Ownership

| Owner                       | Owns                                                                                                                             | Must not own                                                      |
| --------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `BotConversationSource`     | authoritative messages, roster, append-oriented Presence facts                                                                   | pixels, animation frames, transient exit chrome                   |
| Bot Chat View lease         | one deterministic demo event clock per mounted View                                                                              | sharing playback state with another tab or View                   |
| `BotMotionReplayController` | deterministic demo event clock, scene identity, play/pause/seek                                                                  | SVG geometry, pointer coordinates, production protocol state      |
| `BotAvatarStage`            | one `Presence -> visual state` projection, source registry, visibility policy and frame scheduler per participant                | message history, transport reconciliation or per-actor RAF loops  |
| transcript surface          | whether live presence is eligible, group aggregation, 1200 ms label hold, 140 ms exit                                            | avatar physics, protocol state                                    |
| `BotAvatar` engine          | persistent spring values, logical pose clock, sampled geometry, effect transaction, material projection and imperative reactions | choosing the current Presence fact or measuring layout each frame |
| message row                 | historical attribution snapshot                                                                                                  | observing live Presence                                           |
| Composer                    | draft and submit intent                                                                                                          | live activity indicator or avatar state                           |

## Invariants

1. Presence is a transient fact stream, never a persisted chat message.
2. A participant has at most one current Presence projection. Within one run, `seq` is authoritative even if replay observation time is newer; across runs, observation time selects the newer run.
3. Historical message avatars are static. Header and trailing activity marks are the only live avatar surfaces.
4. A streaming assistant message and its trailing working/typing indicator are mutually exclusive. The indicator exits over 140 ms when the message surface takes ownership.
5. An unacknowledged initial user send does not immediately fabricate a working row.
6. Activity text is held for at least 1200 ms and transitions over 300 ms, preventing rapid tool updates from producing visual chatter.
7. Group presence retains every active participant and is aggregated at the transcript boundary; array order is not authority.
8. The animation effect is mounted once per live participant source. Semantic state changes update refs and spring targets instead of recreating the actor or scheduler subscription.
9. One Stage scheduler owns browser RAF/timer work for every participant source. The physics step is capped at `1/120s`; a hidden actor parks its logical clock, so resume cannot jump.
10. Visible working actors run at 60Hz, attention handoffs at 30Hz, ambient actors at 8Hz, and hidden actors at 0Hz. Static marks never subscribe. Reduced-motion clients render one stable target frame with no Morph or particles.
11. Streaming text may update frequently without remounting an existing message or replaying its entry animation.
12. Replay playback state is not run identity. Pausing and resuming a scene keeps its `runId`; only entering another scene creates a new scene epoch.
13. Cross-position motion uses one persistent actor. Header, thread, group, and Composer are placement anchors, not separate owners that remount the avatar.
14. The Stage owns the pointer observation once; individual avatars consume the shared pointer sample and cannot install competing global listeners.
15. Replay scenes are not product UI. The replay clock projects immutable messages and Presence facts; the surface renders them through the normal transcript, group-presence, and Composer paths.
16. A replay controller is View-owned. Two mounted Bot Chat views never share playback position, timers, or pause state.
17. Transient Presence never changes Composer Dock geometry. It may be visually anchored to the Composer, but it remains an overlay so `streaming -> complete` cannot move an already painted message.
18. The Transcript tail has one owner. Presence owns it only before a message surface exists; the optimistic/streaming message takes ownership synchronously, with no retained exiting row that can later change Transcript height.
19. Presentation state is not protocol state. Replay may supply a typed visual override to the Stage, but it cannot invent an AppServer Presence phase or persist a motion name into the conversation.
20. Effects are actor-owned front/back layers. They share the actor clock and geometry, follow `reset -> enter -> hold -> exit -> done`, and never run an unbounded CSS loop, mount an adjacent layout row, or become a second avatar identity.
21. Eye expression is part of the continuous actor model. Width, height, gap, vertical offset, rotation, blink, and gaze are independently interpolated so state changes never swap an SVG subtree.
22. All identity shapes use one OpenCraft-owned 48-point ring topology. Shape changes interpolate from the currently rendered ring, and eye bounds are fitted against the current ring rather than a generic rectangle.
23. Marks own `ResizeObserver` and `IntersectionObserver` measurement. Pointer input may refresh position on pointer events, but no actor animation frame may read layout.
24. Material is participant identity. A static, theme-aware base/highlight/shadow definition may be projected by the renderer; activity state cannot replace it or introduce animated glass, blur, or large gradient paint.
25. A Presence activity target may project an idle participant through a short renderer-only `waking -> listening` handoff. It never creates a protocol phase. Notification and celebration poses are bounded one-shot reactions that settle to idle; celebration requires an explicit presentation action or completion projection, and ordinary reply completion does not fabricate it.

## Current implementation

- Stage projection: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-stage.tsx`
- State policy: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-motion.ts`
- Persistent SVG spring engine: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar.tsx`
- Shared scheduler and rate policy: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-runtime.ts`
- Logical actor clock: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-clock.ts`
- Behavior and blink scheduler: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-behavior.ts`
- Fixed-step springs: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-springs.ts`
- Sampled shape and eye geometry: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-geometry.ts`
- Effect transaction: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-morph.ts`
- Stable identity material: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-material.ts`
- Transcript eligibility and activity lifetime: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-chat-view.tsx`
- Deterministic presentation replay: `plugins/bot-chat/src/motion-replay.ts`
- Eighteen-shape vocabulary: `plugins/bot-chat/src/bot-avatar-shapes.ts`

The replay is deliberately replaceable. A future protocol adapter can publish the same messages and Presence facts; the Stage, persistent actor, pointer following, shape morphs, and cross-position continuity remain unchanged. The old scene-card laboratory is intentionally absent from the product surface.
