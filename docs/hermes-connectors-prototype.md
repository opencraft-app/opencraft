# Hermes connector prototype

Historical downstream integration contract. The plugin and connector runtime are
owned outside the public core; this page does not describe the platform Connector Library.

## Ownership

- Workbench owns only generic settings/view contributions. No connector branch was added to core.
- The downstream Hermes connector plugin owns UI, cloud-service client and installation action.
- A view is bound to a physical Bot ID; switching Bot or logging out disposes its requests.
- The downstream connector runtime owns catalog, instance state, credentials, service clients and skills.
- Hermes uses a stdio MCP bridge to the VM's loopback daemon. Neither COS credentials nor
  the daemon Bearer are stored in Hermes model config or browser persistence.

## User flow

Settings → 连接器 immediately shows a searchable catalogue with original icons,
even before login or installation. Sign in and select a Bot to install the pinned runtime,
supply required tokens, add/connect or disable. The installer URL/checksum live in a collapsed
advanced section, not the primary page.
The installer is an explicit user action, never an effect of opening settings.

`scripts/export-hermes-connector-catalog.mjs` exports public browsing metadata from an explicit
marketplace directory; icons are copied from the same snapshot. This build-time projection contains no
credentials or live authorization state. Installed instances and status always come from the VM.
The 173-entry upstream snapshot is filtered by the plugin's managed-account dependency
policy before browsing/search/counts: 10 managed packages are hidden, including
ima, Tencent Docs and Lexiang whose upstream entries omit auth_mode. Hiding does not delete
or disable any existing VM instance. Browser OAuth is also hidden until its flow is supported:
auth_mode oauth/mcp plus Canva CN/international and WeStock whose manifests omit auth_mode.
This hides 15 entries in total (158 visible); API-key and CLI entries remain available.
`ConnectorSession` owns a Bot/view's cancellable requests and generation fence. A 45-second
probe cannot block explicit installation; cancellation does not claim a remote mutation rolled
back. Old requests cannot publish into a replacement session. PTY command completion assembles
its marker only in actual shell output, so command echo cannot be mistaken for completion.

The connector panel separates catalog and installed state, cards expose
name/description/status, and detail uses token-schema forms. Service icons come from the
marketplace snapshot; managed-account authentication is outside this prototype.

## Delivery

The downstream product owns deployment artifacts, installer sources and the pinned
content-addressed installer URL/checksum in its Hermes plugin. The installer projection
is generated there. Archives include only the binary, marketplace and integration scripts,
never runtime state or keys. Public core does not supply that deployment.

## Deliberate limits

- Linux x64 VM only; the downstream product frontend supports Web and Electron.
- No managed-account authentication or remote OAuth callback forwarding.
- CLI terminal authorization requires a Sidecar advertising `cliAuthPty`; old releases show
  an upgrade notice. This change requires both a new Sidecar and the plugin frontend.
- UI manages one service instance per package; daemon has multi-instance identity.
- New conversation or `/reload-mcp` may be required to discover updated tools.
- Detached daemon survives page closure, but reboot supervision is not part of this prototype.
- Encrypted SQLite exists; disk-full reserve is not implemented.
- Config merge backs up existing YAML and detects edits before replacement, but does not
  constitute a universal lock against other programs that ignore the install lock.

## Verification scope

Sidecar tests exercise an actual MCP fixture through the stdio → HTTP → service chain.
Hermes config tests verify preservation, repeat installation and conflicting-entry rejection.
Plugin tests/typecheck/build verify registration and supported-flow boundaries.
An isolated installation also downloads the COS release with wget, verifies the digest,
runs the compiled daemon, repeats installation, checks icons/skills/config and calls a
fixture tool through the compiled stdio bridge. Actual user-Bot cloud-service installation and
external-service credentials still need an interactive smoke test.

## CLI PTY authorization

The plugin detail panel starts a daemon-owned session through the existing authenticated
cloud-service HTTP transport; it never sends a shell command. `POST /v1/cli-auth/sessions` takes an
existing connector instance ID; the daemon resolves the trusted catalogue command and
uses that instance's isolated HOME and environment. Installation and status checks reuse
the normal connect workflow. The authorization command runs in a real Unix controlling
PTY, created by Python (already an installation prerequisite). The helper is embedded in
the Sidecar binary; there is no native Node addon to distribute. xterm.js belongs to the
plugin view and interprets ANSI output, keyboard input and terminal sizing.

`GET /v1/cli-auth/sessions/:id` returns a bounded in-memory transcript with an absolute
UTF-16 output offset, input readiness and terminal state. The view writes only new output
to xterm; it resets the terminal if it misses the retained window. `POST .../:id/input`
accepts exact terminal input, including control characters, plus monotonically increasing
sequence; duplicates are acknowledged without writing twice. `POST .../:id/cancel` aborts
the process group and clears the transcript. `POST .../:id/resize` sets validated columns
and rows using TIOCSWINSZ. Input and resize requests are serialized by the view. Input is
not persisted; echo and password masking belong to the CLI/PTY, not a browser form.
Third-party CLI output can still contain secrets and the UI warns accordingly.

Sessions last at most 5 minutes, completed transcripts expire after another 5 minutes,
and the registry is bounded to 16 entries. Closing the view requests cancellation, while
daemon timeout protects against a disconnected browser. Authorization is not called
successful until the normal CLI status/reconcile path reports connected. No arbitrary
shell entrypoint, automatic browser opening, or localhost callback tunnelling is added.

Tests cover controlling TTY, raw arrow input, resize, transport closure, password echo,
non-execution of input, duplicate input, separate
sessions, cancellation fencing, and the authenticated HTTP → CLI → status chain with an
isolated fixture (not third-party account credentials).
